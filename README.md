## FAQ
- Is this gonna ban my account?
> No. This uses the local Riot's API which runs at `127.0.0.1:2999` at your computer. Besides that, you are resoinsible for using it.
- Is it legal?
> By no means is this affiliated or supported by Riot Games. This means im the only maintainer and owner.
- Does it support TFT?
> No. At least for now.
- Is this working on Windows?
> It could probably run as expected there as well (probably some minor adjustments needed) but Windows already have native Rich Presence support for the game.
- I got a question
> Feel free to contact me on socials or open an issue here!
